Project Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the projects completed in my data structures course. The focus was on developing a deeper understanding of various data structures and their applications in solving complex problems.

Reflection on Course Projects
1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The primary problem addressed in the projects was the need to efficiently manage and manipulate data using appropriate data structures. This involved handling various data types, ensuring optimal performance, and implementing algorithms that leverage the strengths of different structures to solve specific problems, such as searching, sorting, and storing data effectively.

2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To approach the problem, I conducted thorough research on various data structures, including linked lists, binary search trees, and hash tables. I focused on understanding their unique characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. Data structures are vital to understand because they form the backbone of software design, influencing performance and resource utilization. By choosing the right data structure for a given task, I can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithms used in my projects.

3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
During the projects, I encountered several roadblocks, particularly when implementing more complex data structures like binary search trees. Initially, I struggled with the recursive nature of tree operations and ensuring correct node management during insertion and deletion. To overcome these challenges, I sought additional resources such as online tutorials and documentation, engaged in peer discussions, and practiced coding small examples to reinforce my understanding. This iterative approach helped clarify concepts and improve my coding skills.

4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on these projects has significantly expanded my approach to designing software. I now prioritize a structured approach that includes planning and selecting the most suitable data structures before diving into coding. Understanding the implications of data structure choices has helped me make more informed decisions, leading to cleaner, more efficient code that meets project requirements effectively.

5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project has evolved my programming style to prioritize maintainability, readability, and adaptability. I've learned the importance of writing clear, concise code with meaningful variable names and comments to facilitate understanding for myself and others. Additionally, I now focus on modular design, where functions are purpose-driven and can be easily modified or reused in different contexts. This mindset will serve me well in future projects, allowing for easier debugging and collaboration.
